# Albo-1.0

Albo-1.0 is a multipurpose Discord bot written in Python, with over 30 commands and growing. This is a personal project, made to replace all of the Discord bots a server needs with only one. It is in its early development stage and will progress slowly since I am the only developer.

## Getting Started

To get started with Albo-1.0, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up a Discord bot application and get the bot token.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line: `DISCORD_TOKEN=<your bot token>`
5. Run `python main.py` to start the bot.

## Commands

Albo-1.0 currently has over 30 commands, including:

- `!help`: Displays the list of available commands.
- `!ping`: Pings the bot to check if it's online.
- `!mute`: Mutes a user in the server.
- `!unmute`: Unmutes a previously muted user.

Check the source code or run `!help` to see a full list of commands.
