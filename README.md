# Albo-1.0

Albo is a multipurpose Discord bot written in Python, with over 30 commands and growing. This is a personal project, made to replace all of the bots a server needs with only one. It is in it's early development stage and will progress slowly since I am the only developer.

<!--## Getting Started

To get started with Albo-1.0, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up a Discord bot application and get the bot token.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line: `DISCORD_TOKEN=<your bot token>`
5. Run `python main.py` to start the bot.-->

## Commands

Albo-1.0 currently has over 30 commands, including:

- `/help`: Displays the list of available commands.
- `/prefix`: Sets a custom prefix of your choice.
- `/log`: Configures the log channel of the server, where it logs every single mod command, used by the server staff.
- `-ai`: Sends a given question to ChatGPT and answers directly in the chat.

and much more.

Run `/help` to see an interactive menu with the full lists of commands.
